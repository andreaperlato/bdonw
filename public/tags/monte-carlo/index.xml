It is much more practical to define a function that operates on intervals rather than single values. The standard way of doing this is using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). As an example, we define the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) for heights for male adult students.</description>

This is a problem of discrete probability. 
All right, first, note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365.</description>

At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door, there was a prize. The other two had a goat behind them. And this basically meant that you lost.</description>
