It is a probabilistic classifier that makes classifications using the Maximum A Posteriori decision rule in a Bayesian setting. It can also be represented using a very simple Bayesian network. Naive Bayes classifiers have been especially popular for text classification, and are a traditional solution for problems such as spam detection.
An intuitive explanation for the Maximum A Posteriori Probability MAP is to think probabilities as degrees of belief.</description>
