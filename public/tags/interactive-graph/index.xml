Plotly is designed to build a vast range of visualizations.  Crucially, it has the ability to automatically create interactive charts from the output ggplot2 which is the most abvanced R library to create scientific graphs.  Plotly has a wide range of onscreen tools: zoom is on by default, as are tools for panning and moving around in a chart.</description>
