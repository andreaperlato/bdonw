      <description>body {text-align: justify}Overfitting  In statistics, overfitting is the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably. An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.  Overfitting is the use of models or procedures that violate Occamâ€™s razor, for example by including more adjustable parameters than are ultimately optimal, or by using a more complicated approach than is ultimately optimal.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which two or more predictors in a multiple regression are highly correlated (R-squared more than 0.7), this can inflate our regression coefficients. We can test multicollinearity with the Variance Inflation Factor VIF is the ratio of variance in a model with multiple terms, divided by the variance of a model with one term alone. VIF = 1/1-R-squared. A rule of thumb is that if VIF &amp;gt; 10 then multicollinearity is high (a cutoff of 5 is also commonly used).</description>
