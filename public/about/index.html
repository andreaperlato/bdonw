      <p>I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the filed of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addictis.

<p>After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data. In 2014, very few places were conscious about the role of data science, but I had the good fortune to work for one of these: <a href="https://chorally.com/"><strong>Chorally</strong></a>. Thanks to Chorally, I used the best technology available for companies to obtain useful and usable information from their data.

<p>The goal of this website is to unleash the power of [<strong>R</strong>].
This website is entirely built in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><strong>R</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/"><strong>RStudio</strong></a>.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons to use R for data analytics and data science. Obviously is open source and have been massively extended through tens of thousands of libraries. R is a data specific programming language and it&rsquo;s got 10000 libraries which are very much focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process, and maybe Python doesn&rsquo;t really have right now! Moreover, in Python to turn your analysis into web application you need to use Django and you need the support of a web developer and it takes a lot of work to built these things out.
On the contrary, with R you can actually built reactive web applications as well very faster than Python like [<strong>Shiny</strong>] and [<strong>Flexdashboard</strong>].</p>
