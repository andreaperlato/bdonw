      <p>I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the field of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addicts.

<p>After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data. In 2014, very few places were conscious about the role of data science, but I had the good fortune to work for one of these: <a href="https://chorally.com/"><strong>Chorally</strong></a>. Thanks to Chorally, I used the best technology available for companies to obtain useful and usable information from their data.

<p>The goal of this website is to unleash the power of R.
This website is entirely built in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><strong>R</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/"><strong>RStudio</strong></a>.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons to use R for data analytics and data science. Obviously is open source and have been massively extended through tens of thousands of libraries. R is a data specific programming language and it&rsquo;s got 10000 libraries which are very much focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process, and maybe Python doesn&rsquo;t really have right now! Moreover, in Python to turn your analysis into web application you need to use Django and you need the support of a web developer and it takes a lot of work to built these things out.
On the contrary, with R you can actually built reactive web applications as well very faster than Python using <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/"><strong>Shiny</strong></a> and <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/"><strong>Flexdashboard</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, when Python came out with scikit-learn it was very kind of powerful for machine learnign, but the R community is not sitting still repidly developing and porting al of these libraries over as well. It is also possible in R to access in Keras, Tensorflow, and H2O.</p>

<p>About cloud computing, <a href="https://studio.azureml.net/"><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong></a> has much more pre-built machine learning models then AWS does. Moreover, Microsoft Azure has much better support for R where you can compile and expose your machine learning model by a REST API.</p>

<p>Software production is considered a domain of Python. But again, that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case.
In fact, is possible to containerise R functions into a docker container and expose your functions by REST API.</p>

<p>R is easier for working with data than Python because R was natively built right as a language for data analytics.
In terms of help files and documentations, R helps much better because there is a standard R documentation.</p>

<p>In BI solutions, R has better support for the BI tools, like powerBI and Tableau. In fact, both powerBI and Tableau have built in R integration.</p>

<p>If you are more business facing and not sitting in a software development department, you should really consider R as a tool to build everything from end to end.</p>

<p>Another very important aspect is about SQL. It is really simple to connect SLQ with R because R has database connectors.
You have one language that pretty much does everything in your workflow.</p>

<p>useR!</p>
