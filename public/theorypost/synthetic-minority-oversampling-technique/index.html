<p><strong>Oversampling</strong> and <strong>undersampling</strong> in data analysis are techniques used to adjust the class distribution of a data set. Both oversampling and undersampling involve introducing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias"><strong>bias</strong></a> to select more samples from one class than from another, to compensate for an imbalance that is either already present in the data. Data Imbalance can be of the following types: </br> <strong>Under-representation</strong> of a class in one or more important predictor variables. </br> <strong>Under-representation </strong> of one class in the outcome (dependent) variable. </br></p>
<p>The end result of over/under sampling is the creation of a balanced dataset. Many machine-learning techniques and neural networks, make more reliable predictions from being trained with balanced data. Certain analytical methods, however, notably linear regression and logistic regression, do not benefit from a balancing approach.</p>
<p>There are a number of methods available to oversample a dataset used in a typical classification problem. The most common technique is known as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/chawla02a-html/chawla2002.html"><strong>SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique</strong></a>. </br> It creates new <strong>synthetic observations</strong>. To do that, it identify the feature vector and its nearest neighbour. Then, it take the difference between the two. Crucially, it multiplies the difference with a random number between 0 and 1. We then plot a new data point on the difference line. The feature vector for this new point is our synthetic datapoint.</p>

<p>If we try to identify, for example, fraudolent credit card transactions, we want them in a sufficient number of samples, but a good system do not have more than 5% or 10% of fraud as explained on the right part of the figure above. The complications of the so called <strong>Class Umbalance Problem</strong> are: <strong>Bias Predictions</strong> and <strong>Misleading Accuracy</strong>. In this example, even if we classify all the transactions as non-fraudolent, we will be 95% accurate, but our model does not help despite it gives a very high accuracy. </br></p>
<p>Another important aspect to take into consideration is a problem that may occur during <strong>Validation</strong>, that is the <strong>Inconsistency of the data</strong>. For example, in fraud prevention we cannot split data between January and February because in January people spend more money than February because the Christmas time. </br></p>
<p>Other examples are: manufacturing defects, rare diseases diagnosis and natural disaster.</p>
