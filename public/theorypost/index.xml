      <description>body {text-align: justify}Here an example of the The birthday problem solution via Monte Carlo. Suppose you’re in a classroom with 22 people. If we assume this is a randomly selected group, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday?  All right, first, note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365.  For some calculations, 10,000 experiments might not be computationally feasible, and it might be more than we need.</description>
