      <description>I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the field of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addicts. Find out more.
After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data.</description>
