      <title>Forecasting Product Demand</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Accurately predicting demand for products allows a company to stay ahead of the market.  We will predict demand for multiple products across a region of a state in the US. Then we will roll up these predictions across many different regions of the same state to form a complete hierarchical forecasting system.  We need to forecast the future values of our data.</description>

      <title>Applied Time Series and Forecasting </title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this particular field R is favored over Python. In fact, R has more features for Time Series.  A precious resource is the Rob Hyndman’s Blog. It explains step by step the standard univariate time series analysis.
FIRST  TRENDING DATA  In this example we explore how many people are working in a country: unemployment rate vs. labor force participation rate. That is used for propaganda purposes, because low unemployment rates show an optimistic picture about the economics of a country.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this post, we use some fairly new technology of time series analysis namely neural nets and interactive charting tools. These techniques are the state of the art. The dataset we use for this example has: missing data, outliers, poor formatting.  The dataset i about restaurant at a campsite that is open whole year. There is a peak season in summer, and so we aspect to have seasonal data and trend might be present.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  INTRODUCTION  Who do companies care about supply chain management? We know that food is always at the grocery store, and clothing at the department store. How they get there and who is making those items are there every single day? This is the job of supply chain manager. 
In supply chain management we start with purchasing, some people call it Procurement. The second part is Manufacturing and Operation, where the product is made, and we have to do that quickly and being able to do on a day.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}INTRODUCTION  In statistics, Machine Learning and other Data Science fields, we optimize a lot of stuff. For example in linear regresion, we optimize the Intercept and Slope, or when we use Logistic Regression we optimize the squiggle. Moreover, in t-SNE we optimize clusters. The interesting thing is that gradient descent can optimize all these things and much more. A good example is the Sum of the Squared Residuals in Regression: in Machine Learning lingo this is a type of Loss Function.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  INTRODUCTION  A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights.  The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints.  A short sprint will also help the team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data. 
WORK ON A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT  Typical project upfront requirements and we need to understand what we are going to build before to start the planning project.</description>

      <title>Statistical Background for Time Series</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this post we will review the statistical background for time series analysis and forecasting.  We start about how to compare different time seris models against each other.
Forecast Accuracy  It determine how much difference thare is between the actual value and the forecast for the value. The simplest way to m ake a comparison is via scale dependent error because all the models need to be on the same scale using the Mean Absolute Error - MAE and the Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}We try to recognize cancer in human breast using a multi-hidden layer artificial neural network via H2O package. We use the Wisconsin Breast-Cancer Dataset which is a collectioin of Dr.Wolberg real clinical cases. There are no images, but we can recognize malignal tumor based on 10 biomedical attributes. We have a total number of 699 patients divided in two classes: malignal and benign cancer.</description>

      <guid>/theorypost/event-processing/</guid>
      <description>body {text-align: justify}Process Data  Event data consists of three basic components: the why, the what and the who.  Analysing event data is an iteractive process of three steps: extraction (from raw data to event log), processing (removing redundant details, enrich data by calculating variables) and analysis.  The analysis could be for instance which are the roles of different doctors and nurses organization and how they work together.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function  When summarizing a list of numeric values such as heights, it’s not useful to construct a distribution that assigns a proportion to each possible outcome. It is much more practical to define a function that operates on intervals rather than single values. The standard way of doing this is using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).  As an example, we define the empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) for heights for male adult students.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Here an example of the The birthday problem solution via Monte Carlo. Suppose you’re in a classroom with 22 people. If we assume this is a randomly selected group, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? 
This is a problem of discrete probability. 
All right, first, note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In the 1970s, there was a game show called Let’s Make a Deal. Monty Hall was the hos, this is where the name of the problem comes from. At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door, there was a prize. The other two had a goat behind them. And this basically meant that you lost.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Having a one layer neural network (single layer feedforeward) with the output value to be compare to the actual value. Baed on the activation function we have our output. In order to be able to lear, we have to compare the output value with the actual value via the cost funtion which is the half of the squred difference output and actual value.</description>

The last feature is Spending Score that is a score that the mall computed for each of their clients based on several criteria including for example their income and the number of times per week they show up in the mall and of course, the amount of dollars they spent in a year.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}These are a series of analysis to illustate the main classification algorithms and their advantages. The table shows the business clients of a company that has just launched a new product online. Some of the clients responded positively to the ads by buying the product and other responded negatively by not buying the product. The last column of the table tells for each user if the user bought the product or not.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the field of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addicts.  Find out more.</description>
