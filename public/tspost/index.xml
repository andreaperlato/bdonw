      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this particular field R is favored over Python. In fact, R has more features for Time Series.  A precious resource is the Rob Hyndman’s Blog. It explains step by step the standard univariate time series analysis.
TRENDING DATA In this example we explore how many people are working in a country: unemployment rate vs. labor force participation rate. That is used for propaganda purposes, because low unemployment rates show an optimistic picture about the economics of a country.</description>

      <description>body { text-align: justify}  INTRODUCTION  Who do companies care about supply chain management? We know that food is always at the grocery store, and clothing at the department store. How they get there and who is making those items are there every single day? This is the job of supply chain manager.

      <description>body {text-align: justify}In this post we will review the statistical background for time series analysis and forecasting.  We start about how to compare different time seris models against each other.
Forecast Accuracy  It determine how much difference thare is between the actual value and the forecast for the value. The simplest way to m ake a comparison is via scale dependent error because all the models need to be on the same scale using the Mean Absolute Error - MAE and the Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE.</description>
