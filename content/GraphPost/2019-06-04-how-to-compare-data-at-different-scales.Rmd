I recently underwent to different tests of the so called [**Hair Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_analysis_(alternative_medicine)), and as a result I was given different conclusions. More precisely I sent two of my hair samples to a two different labs, one in Italy and the second in Switzerland. The results are quite different as described by the table and graph below. </br>
In 2011 a [**comprehensive review**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/CS/c1cs15021a#!divAbstract) was published of the scientific literature on hair elemental (mineral) analysis. It conclued that offering a diagnosis as to the cause of an abnormal concentration is currently not feasible and is difficult to see as realistic, for the entire article [**click here**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2011/CS/c1cs15021a#!divAbstract). </br>
Moreover, the [**AMA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association) opposes chemical analysis of the hair as a determinant of the need for medical therapy and supports informing the American public and appropriate governmental agencies of this unproven practice and its potential for health care fraud. </br>
The result that I obtained from the Italian vs. the Swiss Lab confirm the dispute.

As we can see from the table above, it was necessary to convert the result of the Italin Lab from mg/100g to ug/g, in order to compare the Hair Analysis.
