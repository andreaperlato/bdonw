<p>A lot of the times when dashboards are implemented they are with a very specific dataset. The problem with this is that we have to rebuild them from scratch every time. The advantage to use shiny is the possibility to create interactive dashboard or webapp without, and reusing the code already wirtten we can adapt it with new data. Here below, there are some examples of interactive dashboards.</p>
<p><strong>Technical spec of cars</strong> In this example we have a dropdown menu on the left dynamically populated from the data. For each feature inside the dropdown mnu we have the count of the unique values per each features. with have also a second dropdown menu where we can choose between three types of metrics (height, mass, birth_year). At the bottom of the dashboard we have a data table, where we can use a filter by specific columns. The dataset used is <strong>mpg</strong>, which is technical spec of cars like: car manufacturer, model name, engine displacement in liters, year of manufacturing, number of cylinders, type of transmission, drive type, city mileage (miles per gallon), highway mileage (miles per gallon), fuel type.</p>
