<p>In this post we are going to create interactive graphs using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotly"><strong>Plotly</strong></a>. </br> Plotly allows us to create interactive charts, plot and maps with R. Plotly is designed to build a vast range of visualizations. </br> Crucially, it has the ability to automatically create interactive charts from the output <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a> which is the most abvanced R library to create scientific graphs. </br> Plotly has a wide range of onscreen tools: zoom is on by default, as are tools for panning and moving around in a chart. There are even context-aware tools for lassoring selecting points. All of these interactions can be detected and utilized within a <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/"><strong>Shiny</strong></a> web app. Plolty does focus on a scientific and technical audience, providing a wide range of statistical charts. </br></p>
<p>Plotly has the ability to automatically convert a wide range of ggplot2 chatrs into interactive Plotly chart with almost no effort at all. Letâ€™s start with a static chart here below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
load(&quot;C:/07 - R Website/dataset/Graph/british_weather.rdata&quot;)

british_weather %&gt;%
  mutate(tdiff = tmax - tmin) %&gt;%
  group_by(region, mm) %&gt;%
  dplyr::summarise(average.tdiff = mean(tdiff, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = mm,
    y = average.tdiff,
    group = region,
    col = region
  )) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = &quot;Month&quot;, y = &quot;Mean daily temperature difference&quot;) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Mean daily temperature difference in the UK&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Split by region&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Here ablve, we have a nice attractive looking static ggplot2 output. We have a scatterplot with X axis that labels months and Y axis that labels mean daily temperature differences. Now, we can hand this ggplot2 object over to plotly to make it interactive.</p>
