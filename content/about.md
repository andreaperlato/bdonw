I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the field of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addicts.

After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data. In 2014, very few places were conscious about the role of data science, but I had the good fortune to work for one of these: [**Chorally**](https://chorally.com/). Thanks to Chorally, I used the best technology available for companies to obtain useful and usable information from their data.

The goal of this website is to unleash the power of R.
This website is entirely built in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/).

There are many good reasons to use R for data analytics and data science. Obviously is open source and have been massively extended through tens of thousands of libraries. R is a data specific programming language and it's got 10000 libraries which are very much focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process, and maybe Python doesn't really have right now! Moreover, in Python to turn your analysis into web application you need to use Django and you need the support of a web developer and it takes a lot of work to built these things out. 
On the contrary, with R you can actually built reactive web applications as well very faster than Python using [**Shiny**](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [**Flexdashboard**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

Moreover, when Python came out with scikit-learn it was very kind of powerful for machine learnign, but the R community is not sitting still repidly developing and porting al of these libraries over as well. It is also possible in R to access in Keras, Tensorflow, and H2O.

About cloud computing, [**Microsoft Azure**](https://studio.azureml.net/) has much more pre-built machine learning models then AWS does. Moreover, Microsoft Azure has much better support for R where you can compile and expose your machine learning model by a REST API.

Software production is considered a domain of Python. But again, that's not necessarily the case. 
In fact, is possible to containerise R functions into a docker container and expose your functions by REST API.

R is easier for working with data than Python because R was natively built right as a language for data analytics.
In terms of help files and documentations, R helps much better because there is a standard R documentation.

In BI solutions, R has better support for the BI tools, like powerBI and Tableau. In fact, both powerBI and Tableau have built in R integration.

If you are more business facing and not sitting in a software development department, you should really consider R as a tool to build everything from end to end. 

Another very important aspect is about SQL. It is really easy to connect SLQ with R because R has database connectors.
You have one language that pretty much does everything in your workflow.

useR!
