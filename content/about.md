I started my caree as a Data Scientist more than 10 years ago in the filed of Neuroscience at the University of Verona - School of Medicine, Italy. As point person in data analysis, I studied the single and multi-unit recordings from behaving non human primates. Moreover, I have been conducting psychophysic experiments on human subjects to investigate the brain plasticity in drug addictis.

After years of scientific research, I finally discovered the great contribution that could have brought a scientific approach to the business data. In 2014, very few places were conscious about the role of data science, but I had the good fortune to work for one of these: [**Chorally**](https://chorally.com/). Thanks to Chorally, I used the best technology available for companies to obtain useful and usable information from their data.
