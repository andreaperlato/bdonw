<p>Naive Bayes is an effective and commonly-used, machine learning classifier. It is a probabilistic classifier that makes classifications using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation"><strong>Maximum A Posteriori decision rule</strong></a> in a Bayesian setting. It can also be represented using a very simple Bayesian network. Naive Bayes classifiers have been especially popular for text classification, and are a traditional solution for problems such as spam detection.</p>
<p>An intuitive explanation for the <strong>Maximum A Posteriori Probability MAP</strong> is to think probabilities as degrees of <strong>belief</strong>. For example, how likely are we vote for a candidate depends on our <strong>prior belief</strong>. We can modify our stand based on the <strong>evidence</strong>. Our final decision, based on evidence, is the <strong>posterior belief</strong>, which is what happens after we sifted through the evidence. </br> <strong>MPA</strong> is simply the maximum posterior belief: after going through all the debates, what is your most likely decision. </br></p>
<p>We use Naive Bayes in an example to predict, based on some features (e.g. the rank of the school student come from), if a student is admitted or rejected.</p>

Moreover, looking at the boxplot that compare <strong>admit</strong> as a function of <strong>gre</strong>, there is a significant overlap between the two levels of admit. From the dnsity plot of <strong>gre</strong> as a function on <strong>admit</strong>, we can see that students not admitted (admit=1) have higher <strong>gre</strong> comapared to student admitrìted (admit=0). Anyway, there is a significat amount of overlap between the two distributioins. </br> The same is for <strong>gpa</strong>, here not shown. </br></p>

<p>Now, the probability of a student admitted given he belongs to rank one: p(admit=1|rank=1) is equal to: **p(admit=1)*p(rank=1|admit=1)/p(rank=1)**</p>

<p>From the result above, we have <strong>A Priori</strong> probabilities to be admitted of 0.31: only 31% of the students were admitted to the program. Moreover, for numerical variables (gre, gpa) we have mean and standard deviation, and for categorical variables (rank) we have probabilities. For example, p(rank=1|admit=0)=0.103 and p(rank=1|admit=1)=0.245, as we can see from the rsult table above. </br> We have also three plots of the model that represent the density of the numerical variables and the bars for the categorical variable. </br></p>
