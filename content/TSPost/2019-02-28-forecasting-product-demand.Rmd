Accurately predicting demand for products allows a company to stay ahead of the market. </br>
We will predict demand for multiple products across a region of a state in the US. Then we will roll up these predictions across many different regions of the same state to form a complete hierarchical forecasting system. </br>
We need to **forecast the future** values of our data. The best part about time series models is to use information from the past to forecast the future. </br>
If we know the pattern on how an observation at one time period is related to an observation at another time period, then we can recursively forecast the future using this pattern. </br>
What time series are doing is essentially finding th pattern or the signal in our data, and it extrapolate this signal repeatedly over time, namely forecasting. </br>
Of course, we have signal but also noise. The remaining noise is what helps us to estimate confidence intervals around oyr forecast. </br>

There are  lots of ways of measuring accuracy in time series models. The common measures are the followiong:

The **Mean Absolute Error MAE** is the avverage measure of how far away our prediction is from the actual value, in absolute term. So, it predicts at the same scale of our data. The downside is there is not a reference, and the prediction error might be out of place. </br>
To solve this problem we use the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error MAPE** that is the average measure of how far away in absolute percentage term, our prediction is from the actual value. Thsi makes our prediction not depending on the scale of our data.

**COMPONENT OF DEMAND** </br>
Economic theory has a lot to say about predicting values of demand. Obviously, external factors like price, seasonality, and timing of promotions will drive some aspects of product demand. </br>
Here, we will learn about the basics around [**Price Elasticity Models PED**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand) and how to incorporate seasonality and promotion timing factors into our product demand forecasts.
