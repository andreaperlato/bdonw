**INTRODUCTION** </br>
Who do companies care about supply chain management?
We know that food is always at the grocery store, and clothing at the department store.
How they get there and who is making those items are there every single day? This is the job of supply chain manager. </br>

In supply chain management we start with purchasing, some people call it **Procurement**. The second part is **Manufacturing** and **Operation**, where the product is made, and we have to do that quickly and being able to do on a day.to-day basis. The third stage is **Logistic** and **Transportation**. In order to deliver to customers. Summarizing, supply chain is about: Buy things, Make things and Move things. 

Of course, modern supply chain extends beyond purchasing, operations, and logistics, and involves IT, designer, accountant, and collaborate with finance to create a budget that will maximize the return on investment. </br>

**PROFIT = REVENUE - COST** </br>
Supply chain is about cutting cost, but cricually it cut costs that will hurt the company. In fact, modern supply chain must be dual contributors to profit: creating great products that arrive on time, and controlling costs by eliminating waste. </b>

In order to create great products we need to know what customers want, and we also need to understand how to differentiate ourselves to our competitors.
Considering two companies we have to ask the questions depicted on the figure below.
