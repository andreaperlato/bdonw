<p>There are differences between <strong>Parametric Models</strong>, <strong>Semi-Parametric Models</strong>, and <strong>Non-Parametric Momdels</strong>. </br> The graph below gives the main pieces of information. A survival analysis can be defined as consisting of two parts: the core survial object with a time indicator plus the corresponding event status (used to calculate the baseline hazard). The second part of the survival model consists of the covariates. </br> We have to keep in mind that both of these parts can have a different distributions, or it is totally possible that no distribution at all is assumed.</p>

<p>There are many distributioin and these distributions have different probability patterns in hisogram depending on th fiel of reseach. For example, in economics a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution"><strong>Pareto distribution</strong></a> is often used to described the wealth situation in a given society. It is a fairly good way to show if a large chunk of money is owned by just a small amount of people. In survival analysis, there is not a clear cut, there are a few of commonly used. Mainly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution"><strong>Exponential Distribution</strong></a> as well of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution"><strong>Weibull Distribution</strong></a> are common choices.</p>
