There are differences between **Parametric Models**, **Semi-Parametric Models**, and **Non-Parametric Momdels**. </br>
The graph below gives the main pieces of information. A survival analysis can be defined as consisting of two parts: the core survial object with a time indicator plus the corresponding event status (used to calculate the baseline hazard). The second part of the survival model consists of the covariates. </br>
We have to keep in mind that both of these parts can have a different distributions, or it is totally possible that no distribution at all is assumed.

There are many distributioin and these distributions have different probability patterns in hisogram depending on th fiel of reseach. For example, in economics a [**Pareto distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution) is often used to described the wealth situation in a given society. It is a fairly good way to show if a large chunk of money is owned by just a small amount of people. 
In survival analysis, there is not a clear cut, there are a few of commonly used. Mainly the [**Exponential Distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) as well of the [**Weibull Distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution) are common choices.
