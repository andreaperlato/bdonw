<p>Accurately predicting demand for products allows a company to stay ahead of the market. </br> We will predict demand for multiple products across a region of a state in the US. Then we will roll up these predictions across many different regions of the same state to form a complete hierarchical forecasting system. </br> We need to <strong>forecast the future</strong> values of our data. The best part about time series models is to use information from the past to forecast the future. </br> If we know the pattern on how an observation at one time period is related to an observation at another time period, then we can recursively forecast the future using this pattern. </br> What time series are doing is essentially finding th pattern or the signal in our data, and it extrapolate this signal repeatedly over time, namely forecasting. </br> Of course, we have signal but also noise. The remaining noise is what helps us to estimate confidence intervals around oyr forecast. </br></p>
