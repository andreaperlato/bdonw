<p>We try to recognize cancer in human breast using a multi-hidden layer artificial neural network. We use the Wisconsin Breast-Cancer Dataset which is a collectioin of Dr.Wolberg real clinical cases. There are no images, but we can recognize malignal tumor based on 10 biomedical attributes. We have a total number of 699 patients divided in two classes: malignal and benign cancer.</p>
