What an artifical neuron do is to calculate a **weighted sum** of its input, adds a bias and then decides whether it should be “fired” or not.

considering the neuron of the figure above, the value of Y can be anything ranging from -inf to +inf. The neuron really doesn’t know the bounds of the value. How do we decide whether the neuron should fire or not? We use **Activatioin Functions** for this purpose. To check the Y value produced by a neuron and decide whether outside connections should consider this neuron as fired or not.
