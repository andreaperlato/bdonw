<p>What an artifical neuron do is to calculate a <strong>weighted sum</strong> of its input, adds a bias and then decides whether it should be “fired” or not.</p>

<p>considering the neuron of the figure above, the value of Y can be anything ranging from -inf to +inf. The neuron really doesn’t know the bounds of the value. How do we decide whether the neuron should fire or not? We use <strong>activatioin functions</strong> for this purpose. To check the Y value produced by a neuron and decide whether outside connections should consider this neuron as fired or not.</p>
