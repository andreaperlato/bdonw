<p><strong>Process Data</strong> </br> Event data consists of three basic components: the why, the what and the who. </br> Analysing event data is an iteractive process of three steps: extraction (from raw data to event log), processing (removing redundant details, enrich data by calculating variables) and analysis. </br> The analysis could be for instance which are the roles of different doctors and nurses <strong>organization</strong> and how they work together. There is also in the analysis the <strong>controll-flow prospective</strong> (e.g. what is the journey of a patient throughthe emergency rooms). Finally, the performance prospective, focus on the time and <strong>efficiency</strong> (e.g. how long does it take before a patient can leave the emergency rooms). </br></p>
<p><strong>A first glimpse of the event log</strong> Some initial question about event log are: </br> How many <strong>cases</strong> are described? </br> How many distinct <strong>activities</strong> are performed? </br> How many <strong>events</strong> are recorded? </br> What is the <strong>time period</strong> in which the data is recorded? </br></p>
<p>To analys the process data, we use the <a href="https://www.bupar.net/index.html"><strong>bupaR package</strong></a>. In the following exercise we will have a look at a process data, which descries the journey of patients in a hospital.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(bupaR)

# summary(patients)

12 events
1 traces
1 cases
6 activities
6 activity instances

<p>As shown above, the first patient went through six events: registration, triage, blood tests, an MRI scan, discussion of results, and check out, over the course of a week in January 2017.</p>
