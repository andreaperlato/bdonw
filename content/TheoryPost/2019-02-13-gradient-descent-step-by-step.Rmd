**INTRODUCTION** </br>
In statistics, Machine Learning and other Data Science fields, we optimize a lot of stuff. For example in linear regresion, we optimize the Intercept and Slope, or when we use Logistic Regression we optimize the squiggle. Moreover, in t-SNE we optimize clusters. The interesting thing is that gradient descent can optimize all these things and much more.
