**Oversampling** and **undersampling** in data analysis are techniques used to adjust the class distribution of a data set. Both oversampling and undersampling involve introducing a [**bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias) to select more samples from one class than from another, to compensate for an imbalance that is either already present in the data. Data Imbalance can be of the following types: </br>
**Under-representation** of a class in one or more important predictor variables. </br>
**Under-representation ** of one class in the outcome (dependent) variable. </br>

The end-result of over-/under-sampling is the creation of a balanced dataset. Many machine-learning techniques and neural networks, make more reliable predictions from being trained with balanced data. Certain analytical methods, however, notably linear regression and logistic regression, do not benefit from a balancing approach.

There are a number of methods available to oversample a dataset used in a typical classification problem. The most common technique is known as [**SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume16/chawla02a-html/chawla2002.html). /br>
It creates new **synthetic observations**. To do that, it identify the feature vector and its nearest neighbour. Then, it take the difference between the two. Crucially, it multiplies the difference with a random number between 0 and 1. We then plot a new data point on the difference line. The feature vector for this new point is our synthetic datapoint.

If we try to identify, for example, fraudolent credit card transactions, we want them in a sufficient number of samples, but a good system do not have more than 5% or 10% of fraud as explained on the right part of the figure above.
