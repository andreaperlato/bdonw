**Introduction**
A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. </br>
The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. </br>
A short sprint will also help the team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data. </br>

**Work on a data science project**
Typical project upfront requirements and we need to understand what we are going to build before to start the planning project. It also focuses on **delivering scopre**, **schedule**, and **budget**. </br> Finally, a typical project delivers a product or service. </br>

Data Science project is different. The team explore new opportunity, make data more accessible for the compani and a better understand of it.
So, there is no a detailed description about what to find before you start looking into the data. </br>
On the contrary, project managment requires to define process and a fully understand your deliverable. </br>
Data Science is an empirical process, where we need to expect the unexpected if we want to gain new insights. It is a process focused of research. We have to stop planning and start exploring.
