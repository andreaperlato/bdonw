**INTRODUCTION** </br>
A data science team asks great questions, explores the data, and delivers key insights. </br>
The best way to generate business value is to deliver a constant stream of key insights in short two-week sprints. </br>
A short sprint will also help the team pivot so they can ask new questions based on what they learn from the data. </br>

**WORK ON A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT** </br>
Typical project upfront requirements and we need to understand what we are going to build before to start the planning project. It also focuses on **delivering scopre**, **schedule**, and **budget**. </br> Finally, a typical project delivers a product or service. </br>

Data Science project is different. The team explore new opportunity, make data more accessible for the compani and a better understand of it.
So, there is no a detailed description about what to find before you start looking into the data. </br>
On the contrary, project managment requires to define process and a fully understand your deliverable. </br>
Data Science is an empirical process, where we need to expect the unexpected if we want to gain new insights. It is a process focused of research. We have to stop planning and start exploring. Data Science process is not a project but a discovery. </br>

Data science teams are empirical and exploratory. We are used in a meeting to talk about: mission, objectives, and outcomes. That is why it is difficult to step back and imagine a team of a pure exploration. </br>


**TYPICAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH** </br>
In a typical project management approach, a data science team is composed by **one reseach lead** **two data analysts** and **one project manager**. The goal is to make the needs of the company or of the customer actionable and increase value or revenue. Tipical questions are:</br>
What do we know about the customer? </br>
What we assume? </br>
Why does our customers shop with us instead of our competitors? </br>
What might make our customers shop even more? </br>

By doing that, data analysts create reports or analyze social media platforms and create a word cloud of feedbacks from thousands of customers.
**The problem is that by knowing more about our customers that generate more questions**. We continue to drop what we found to explore new aree.
In other words, we know what we want to find but we are not learing something new.
Moreover, if we don't know how long the team is working to find insights, then we don't know the bugget and its time to be delivered.

In other words, a data science project won't fit with into a traditional project management framework. </br>


**HOW TO USE SUCCESS CRITERIA** </br>
Thomas Edison said about a failed experiment that was not a fail. There is always something new to learn from fails, and there is the opportunity to be free to try a different way. This is the same approach that Data Science Teams have. They run many experiments on the data and not every experiment leads to insights.
It is a good idea to create success criteria, and objectives for the team. That is a good compromise between project management and data science. </br>
The goals are: </br>
**Make the team transparent** and not isolated from the rest of the organiation. </br>
**Try to solve large problems**, this means that the lead research needs to have ambitious questions. If the questions are too timid, then it might be difficult to sho results. </br>
**Show what the team is learning** using regularly scheduled storytelling sessions. </br>

If you are the **project manager of the data science team** you must be able to: </br>
Work hard to stay connected with the rest of the company. </br>
Stay transaparent about what you find. </br>
Give frequent demonstrations of insights, by doing that, the rest of the organization understand the value in data science. </br>
