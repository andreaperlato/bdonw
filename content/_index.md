[**Andrea Perlato**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreaperlato/) Website has been designed to share information about Data Science.
There are two main topics: machine learning and artificial, both explained along with real world examples.

The website is entirely built in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with [**blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
R is the best data specific programming language focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process.

The take home message is: [**useR!**](https://user2019.r-project.org/) and do not foget that [**all models are wrog, some models are useful**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
