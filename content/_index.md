This website has been designed to share information about Data Science.
There are two main topics: machine learning and artificial, both explained along with real world examples.

In order to unleash the the power of R, the website is entirely built in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) with [**blogdown**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).
R is the best data specific programming language focused around data analyst and data scientist kind of process.
It is also one of the faster ways to buil dashboards and web apps.

The take home message is: [**useR!**](https://user2019.r-project.org/) and do not foget that [**all models are wrong, some models are useful**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
